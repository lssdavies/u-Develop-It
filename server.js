Because params can be accepted in the database call as an array, params is assigned as an array with a single element, req.params.id.

 The JSON object route response will be the message "deleted", with the changes property set to result.affectedRows. Again, this will verify whether any rows were changed.
 The else if statement comes in if there are no affectedRows as a result of the delete query, that means that there was no candidate by that id. Therefore, we should return an appropriate message to the client, such as "Candidate not found".

 we use the HTTP request method post() to insert a candidate into the candidates table. We'll use the endpoint /api/candidate. In the callback function, we'll use the object req.body to populate the candidate's data. Notice that we're using object destructuring to pull the body property out of the request object. Until now, we've been passing the entire request object to the routes in the req parameter. In the callback function block, we assign errors to receive the return from the inputCheck function.
 If the inputCheck() function returns an error, an error message is returned to the client as a 400 status code, to prompt for a different user request with a JSON object that contains the reasons for the errors.
In order to use this function, we must import the module first. line 6 above
the database call here uses a prepared statement that's a bit different than the one we used previously in the lesson. This is because there is no column for the id. MySQL will autogenerate the id and relieve us of the responsibility to know which id is available to populate.

The params assignment contains three elements in its array that contains the user data collected in req.body.

The database call logic is the same as what we previously built to create a candidate. Using the query() method, we can execute the prepared SQL statement. We send the response using the res.json() method with a success message and the user data that was used to create the new data entry.
